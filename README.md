Contains algorithms implementing simple self learning agents:

## CFR Rock paper scissors

Two Rock-Paper-Scissors agent plays one another and changes their strategies again depending on opponents actions reaching Nash Equilibrium. The algorithm is described in Python in [this paper](http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2013/cfr/cfr.pdf).
